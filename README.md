# MANGO

### What is Mango
Mango is a decentralized, privacy-focused platform designed to streamline financial management for GitHub organizations, enabling moderators to securely manage funds and distribute rewards & contributors to claim their reward. Built on Goerli for now, Mango leverages Sismo Connect for anonymous authentication and Safe for account abstraction and multisig wallet functionality.

Moderators of the repo/organization can manage a Multisig Account Abstraction (AA) Wallet, initiating and approving internal transfers within the organization. Sismo Connect ensures their identities remain private while facilitating secure wallet interactions. The multisig feature provides an additional layer of security, requiring multiple approvals for transactions to be executed.

### Next Steps
Mango also introduces a seamless airdrop system for rewarding contributors. Moderators can create token airdrops and Contributors can then claim their rewards using Sismo Connect, ensuring their privacy is maintained throughout the process. The platform integrates with an ERC-20 token smart contract for efficient token distribution.

By combining privacy, security, and convenience, Mango aims to revolutionize financial management and rewards distribution in the GitHub ecosystem, fostering a more collaborative and engaging environment for open-source projects.
